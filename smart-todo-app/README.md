```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Web server (for PWA features) or can be run locally

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smart-todo-app
   ```

2. **Run Locally**
   - **Option 1**: Open `index.html` directly in a browser
   - **Option 2**: Use a local server (recommended for PWA features)
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js
     npx serve .
     
     # Using PHP
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
   - For direct file access: `file:///path/to/smart-todo-app/index.html`

### First-Time Setup
1. The app will load with no tasks initially
2. Add your first task using the form in the sidebar
3. Explore the features: search, filter, sort, and theme toggle
4. Install as PWA (if using a web server) for the best experience

## 💻 Usage Guide

### Adding Tasks
1. Fill in the task title (required)
2. Optionally add description, due date, and priority
3. Click "Add Task" or press Enter
4. Use the voice button for speech-to-text input

### Managing Tasks
- **Complete**: Click the checkmark button
- **Edit**: Click the edit (pencil) button
- **Delete**: Click the delete (trash) button
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop task cards

### Filtering and Search
- Use the search box for real-time filtering
- Click filter buttons for status-based filtering
- Change sort order using the dropdown menu

### Data Management
- **Export**: Download all tasks as JSON
- **Import**: Upload a previously exported JSON file
- **Print**: Generate a printer-friendly view
- **Clear All**: Remove all tasks (with confirmation)

### Themes and Customization
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Theme preference is automatically saved
- Responsive design adapts to screen size

## 🔧 Customization

### Themes
The application uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;
    --success-color: #10b981;
    --warning-color: #f59e0b;
    --danger-color: #ef4444;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Adding New Features
The modular JavaScript architecture makes it easy to extend:

1. Add new methods to the `SmartTodoApp` class
2. Bind new event listeners in the `bindEvents()` method
3. Update the UI in the `updateUI()` method
4. Save new data with `saveToStorage()`

### Styling Modifications
- Edit `style.css` for visual changes
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Media queries handle responsive behavior
- Print styles are in `print.css`
